               That matters most where the answer feeds back into what it was

               POLY_ARRAY on the round before Field.add's own return settles
               makes the caller's accumulator poly, which makes this method's
               own parameters poly, which makes `a[i]` poly -- and the cycle has
               no way back. Waiting one round instead lets the concrete entry
               point (an int-array literal, a zero element) propagate all the
               way round, and the whole field settles on the Integer array.

               The second stage, with g_infer_optimistic cleared, still answers
               POLY_ARRAY for an element that genuinely never settles -- an
               empty `[]`, a heterogeneous block. The narrower rule below is

     A bool is not the only such answer -- a Symbol, a Class, a Rational and a
     Complex have no C nil either, and the guard boxed nil into their slot all
     the same. The two rules in infer_uncached that call a `&.` poly are placed
     by POSITION in the inference chain, so a name resolved before them
     (`class`, `to_sym`) never reached one; this one runs after every arm and
     asks the property that actually decides it: can the answer's C type hold
     a nil? Integer and Float have their sentinels, String and the arrays and
     the reference objects have NULL, so those keep their concrete type and
     the guard uses that nil (the array trio of #3461 is this same rule).
     The receiver's type does not narrow this. A miss on a specialized
     container is the element type's C nil -- a NULL string, SP_INT_NIL --
     not a poly nil, so `h["zz"]&.empty?` reached the guard with a concrete
     receiver and answered `false` where CRuby answers nil (#4070). `&.` is
     the program saying nil is possible; the answer has to be able to hold
