# A builtin arithmetic operator on a yield, from a method whose blocks answer
# different types at different call sites. The operator was typed from the
# first site's block, so `yield + yield` with a String block and then a Float
# one put the Float into a `const char *` and the C did not compile. Codegen
# already lowers the operator per site; its result is now boxed into the
# method's value.
