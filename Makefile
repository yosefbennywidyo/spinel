# Usage:
#   make              Build the C compiler (runtime + spinel + tools)
#   make test         Run the feature tests (always a fresh run)
#   make bench        Run benchmarks vs CRuby
#   make bench-compile  Time analysis/emission on a synthetic program at K=100, 200
#   make optcarrot    End-to-end optcarrot integration test
#   make check        Fast pre-commit: rebuild + tests
#   make gate         Full pre-push: test || bench || optcarrot (reuses the
#                     passes of unchanged programs, see RUN_ONE_TEST)
#   make gate-full    The same with GATE_CACHE=0: every program built and run
#   make clean        Remove built binaries

# Bundled carried-C spin packages (Path B). Defined here, before `all`, because

# The probe compiles AND LINKS a use of the API sp_openssl.c needs, not just
# the header: a system with headers but no libssl, or one too old for
# TLS_client_method, would otherwise pass the header check and fail at the
# package's own link.
#
# KEG-ONLY INSTALLS. On a Homebrew host the headers and libraries are real
# but off the default search path, so a bare $(CC) fails this probe and the
# whole package -- sp_openssl.o, `require "openssl"`, and every
# packages/openssl/test/*.rb -- drops out of the build without saying so.
# A green `make test` there has not exercised the package at all, which is
# how an .expected file for it can be written from a run that never
# happened.
#
# So: probe bare first, and only if that fails ask for a prefix and probe
# AGAIN with -I/-L. A prefix is trusted only when it passes the same
# compile-and-link probe, so a stale or partial install cannot flip this to
# yes and then fail at the package's own link. On a host where the bare
# probe already passes, nothing below runs and the build is unchanged.
# TWO questions, because they have different answers. The link probe says
# libssl is here and usable. The syntax-only compile of the package's own
# source says THIS file can be built against it -- a version floor, a renamed
# API, a missing macro. A header set that answers the first and not the second
# (LibreSSL 3.1.5, whose TLS_client_method exists but whose evp.h has no
# EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IVLEN) used to pass the probe and then stop `make` in the
# middle with a #error. Compiling the real file rather than a copy of its
# version guard is what keeps the two from drifting (#4253).

# ---- Minor-mark leg (#4311) ----
# The generational mark is the default (2026-09-12), so the suite runs under
# it; this leg keeps the other mode honest too. Each program here is built to
# catch a missed write barrier -- a young value stored into a long-lived
# thread-local map, held only by the map between the write and the read --
# and runs with the mark on and off, then under the verifier with stress.
# It costs a fifth of a second, and it is the leg that was missing when a
# barrier pointed at the wrong object shipped.
# One leg per barrier gap that shipped. A single program was what this target
# ran when a store into a capture cell shipped with no barrier at all, so a
# fix here adds its reproducer to the list rather than testing by hand.
# SPINEL_GC_PHASES only reports; it must not change what a program computes, and
# it must say nothing at all when it is off. Both halves are the contract, and
# neither is visible to the ordinary harness, which cannot vary the environment
# per test.

# ---- Allocation locality: the same graph, laid down by 1 worker or by N ----
# test/gc_locality_build.rb answers what the mark split in #4384 left open. The
# root walk is 0.000 s at every worker count, so the mark's rise with workers
# is the trace; this separates "who allocated the graph" from "who marks it" by
# holding the second still and varying the first. Measured on the ladder in its
# header, the per-object trace cost is set by the number of workers that
# ALLOCATED -- 3.74 ns at one, 5.56 at two, and flat out to sixteen.
#
# What is gated here is the correctness half of that, which is worth having on
# its own: a graph built across N workers must BE the graph built by one. The
# checksum is over the whole structure, so a node allocated on one worker and
# published to another without the store being seen -- or a slot recycled while
# still reachable -- changes it. That is the shape of three of the defects this
# workload family has found, and none of them crashed.
#
# The collection floor is here for the same reason as in threaded-render-test:
# an arm that stops collecting still prints the right checksum and defends
# nothing. The marks-per-collection floor beside it asks whether the graph is
# held live, which is a question about the FULL mark: that probe runs with
# SPINEL_GC_MINOR=0, since a minor cycle walks the young objects plus the
# remembered set and would answer a much smaller number for the same graph.
#
# LOCALITY_CHURN is NOT varied per arm, and that is deliberate twice over. It
# is what decides how many workers a cell really runs -- the pool grows toward
# one worker per live green thread, so SPINEL_WORKERS is a cap and the churn
# count is the demand -- and the program's default of 8 is what makes the W=8
# arm below an eight-worker run rather than a six-worker one. Holding it equal
# across the arms is also what lets every arm be compared against ONE expected
# file: it is part of the answer, so varying it per cell would mean either a
# file per cell or dropping it from the comparison, and it is the wrong thing
# to drop.

# ---- The threaded render benchmark, as a correctness gate (#4384) ----
# benchmark/bm_threaded_render.rb is the only workload in the tree that runs
# the collector under real concurrency: 32 green threads, each holding a
# request's whole render live across a Thread.pass. Everything the threaded
# collector does that the single-threaded one does not -- the parallel slot
# sweep, the per-worker string budget, the root walk over another worker's
# fibers -- is on that path, and three of the last defects found there were
# silent wrong answers rather than crashes.
#
# So the benchmark is run here for its ANSWER, not its time. The digests are
# position-sensitive and fixed by each thread's index, so they do not depend
# on the interleaving: a collection that frees a live fragment, or hands one
# thread another's buffer, changes stdout.
#
# The matrix is worker count crossed with the budget policies, because those
# are what move WHEN a collection lands relative to a half-built page, which
# is the state the bugs were in. SPINEL_WORKERS=1 is included deliberately:
# it is the cooperative model, and a green thread parked at a yield with the
# collector running on the same worker is a different root set from a green
# thread parked while another worker collects.
#
# Two shape assertions keep the leg discriminating rather than merely green.
# A benchmark that stops collecting, or whose live graph shrinks to nothing,
# still produces the right digests -- and would defend nothing.

# The .ok target is the test's stamp. Order-only $(SPINEL) keeps a
# compiler relink from invalidating every test.
# One snapshot test: compile $< with the integrated pipeline, run, diff
# against $<.expected (or CRuby), write PASS/FAIL/ERR to $@. Shared by the
# test/ rule and the per-package rules below.
# The generated C goes to a stable path derived from $@ (not the per-test
# tmpdir): the compile hash sccache computes covers the preprocessed source,
# which embeds the input path in #line directives, so a random tmpdir path
# would give every run a fresh cache key and the cache would never hit.
# The .c/.o are deleted after the link -- only the cache entry survives.
# The generated C names the external libraries its ffi_lib declarations asked
# for, as `/* SPINEL_LINK: -lfoo */` markers -- the same ones the spinel driver
# scrapes when it drives cc itself. This rule drives cc directly, so it has to
# read them too, or a package binding a system library (openssl) fails to link.
# Link what the driver would link. A TU that uses Thread carries codegen's
# /* SPINEL_USES_THREADS */ marker, and src/main.c answers it with the
# -DSP_THREADS archive plus -lpthread; the harness used to link the N=1
# cooperative archive for every test, so every threaded test ran in a
# configuration that never ships -- and a test whose main thread blocks in a
# syscall while another green thread must make progress deadlocked here and
# nowhere else. The PCH is dropped on that path: it was built without
# -DSP_THREADS and -Werror rejects the mismatch.
# `bigopt` below: -O1 beats -O0 on a typical test, because the optimizer prunes
# spinel_rt.h's 800+ unreferenced statics before codegen (see the OPT=-O1 note on
# `check`). But the cost of the passes that stay is superlinear in the size of
# ONE function, and a test's whole program is inlined into main. io_closed_stream
# has a 5373-line main: 82s at -O1 against 1.6s at -O0, with a roughly cubic
# curve through it (928 lines 0.9s, 3219 lines 15s, 4407 lines 43s). Past 2000
# generated lines that one function dominates and -O0 wins by a wide margin. The
# PCH is dropped with it, since it was built under the other -O and would not
# load anyway. The binaries are the same speed here -- these are wide-API tests
# rather than loops, 0.023s vs 0.024s on the worst one.
#
# The result cache (tools/result_cache.sh). spinel always runs: the C it emits
# is how the harness knows whether anything changed, and most commits change
# the C of few programs (a refactor, none). When it is the same C as in a run
# that PASSED, built the same way against the same runtime, with the same
# expectations, the compile and the run are skipped and the stored PASS is
# reused. The key of one program is the hash of
#   - the generated C text and the .rb source;
#   - its .expected, .err.expected, .args and .stdin (absent counts too);
#   - the compile and link line as this recipe assembles it for THIS program
#     ($(CC), CFLAGS/OPT, the -O0 override, the overflow and thread defines,
#     the PCH flag, the archive and package objects picked, -l flags), and the
#     timeout;
#   - RESULT_CACHE_FP, computed once per run after the prerequisites are
#     built: the content of both runtime archives, every bundled package
#     object, both PCH files and build/spinel-timeout, every header under lib/
#     and packages/, `$(CC) --version` and -dumpmachine, the OS and
#     architecture, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH/LIBRARY_PATH;
#   - RESULT_CACHE_HARNESS: bump it when this recipe's logic changes how a
#     result is decided.
# Only PASS is stored, never a failure, so a cached result can only repeat a
# pass that this exact binary, run against these exact expectations, earned.
# What a hit assumes:
#   - spinel affects the outcome only through the C it writes (the C is
#     hashed, not the compiler binary, which is the point);
#   - the binary is a function of the key: the same C, headers, PCH, archives,
#     objects, flags and compiler give the same program. libc, the system
#     libraries a test links (-lssl, -lffi) and the kernel are out of scope;
#   - the run is a function of the binary and its inputs. That does not hold
#     for a program that reads the clock, the environment, the random source,
#     files (a fixture a commit edits leaves the C alone), the network, other
#     processes or threads' timing, or the GC's counters, so such a program is
#     never cached: tools/result_cache.sh's `nocache` scans the test and every
#     local file it requires for those identifiers, and `# spinel: no-cache` in
#     a test opts out anything the scan does not see. A test without
#     .expected compares against CRuby's run and is never cached either.
# A reused pass leaves <test>.ok.cached beside the .ok, so
# `ls build/test-results/*.cached | wc -l` counts what was skipped.
# GATE_CACHE=0 (or `make gate-full`) runs everything. The entries live in
# build/result-cache, one file per key written by rename, so concurrent runs
# and configurations (CC=clang, -m32, OPT) share it safely; entries unused for
# two weeks are pruned when the test results are cleared.

# ---- Developer gates ----

# `test`, `bench` and `optcarrot` only READ the compiler binaries and

# prerequisites. Every recursive $(MAKE) is `+`-prefixed so the jobserver
# fd is inherited; none pass an explicit -j (which would force a sub-make
# to spawn its own pool → oversubscription).

# Fast pre-commit: rebuild the compiler and run the suite. OPT=-O1 compiles
# the spinel_rt.h-heavy per-test C ~3x faster than -O0 (the optimizer prunes
# the 800+ unreferenced static fns before codegen). Skips bench/optcarrot --
# run `make gate` before pushing for those.

# four times before anyone profiled it (rubys/roundhouse#72), pushes it well
# past. The count is deterministic, so the test does not depend on the

# what is still superlinear is too small to show, and real applications are
# larger than either (rubys in #5035; lobsters is ~78K lines as emitted).

# program) but the emission's work does not: the emission alone reads 13.9x
# and the whole compile 6.39x. Sampled every 4,096 units, about 470M of the
# 1.16G units above 4x are walks of the program repeated per call site or per
# method: singleton_def_of under arity_violation, whose table is cached but

# since the last call (401 rebuilds for 1,200 calls at 400 units),
# fi_fiber_stack_risk under emit_method_signature, and scope_has_return's scan
# of a node kind under call_breaks. The limit sits just above; lower it as
# those go. One walk of
# the node table per emitted method reads 7.66x. The count does not see a
# scan that compares ids before names: scope_is_shadowed's scan of every
# later scope, per class at every poly dispatch, was 11% of gen.sh 400's

# POLY seed, Strings lent to a parameter that appends, poly dispatch with
# arguments that run, splat and keyword plans, yield(*row) into block
# parameters, nullable locals, escaping blocks and writes past an array's
# end: gen.sh has none of them, so a pass that walks the program per call
# site of one costs it nothing. #6135's first an_local_has_alias, a walk of
# the node table per call site of a lent parameter, leaves gen.sh at 6.39x
# and reads 5.40x here (5.20x against 4.32x on its own base); a walk per
# argument the binder runs first reads 4.98x. Today's 4.28x is what is left
# once a diverging yield's typing stopped walking the table per yield (4.55x
# before); the limit sits about 5% above, and the same two walks, put back on
# top of that, read 5.19x and 4.73x. The count sees node accesses and name
# compares, not a pass's scan of its own side table: #6183's handle registry,
